# Twilio and Passcode demo using NodeJS npm mdules

This is a simple demo application that sends an SMS to a recipient using Node and Twilio API

#### Getting Started ####
1. Sign up for a free trial Twilio account (http://www.twilio.com/signup)
2. Get an Account SID
3. Get an Authentication Token
4. Go to project root directory and run "npm install"

## Keeping your SID and Token secure
It is strongly advised to keep these keys hidden from your commit history since they can be compromised if they are visible. Instead of coding them into your application, save them as environmental variables and add the folder that contains the keys to your `.gitignore` file
